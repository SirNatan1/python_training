Variables store data in a computer memory. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that
can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored.
Number at the beginning, special character, hyphen are not allowed when naming a variable. A variable can have a short name (like x, y, z),
but a more descriptive name (firstname, lastname, age, country) is highly recommended.
Python var rules:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)
E.g for valid var names: firstname, first_name, current_year_2021
E.g for invalid var names: first@name, 1num, num-1

We will use standard Python variable naming style which has been adopted by many Python developers. Python developers use snake case(snake_case)
variable naming convention. We use underscore character after each word for a variable containing more than one word(eg. first_name, last_name, engine_rotation_speed).
The example below is an example of standard naming of variables, underscore is required when the variable name is more than one word.
When we assign a certain data type to a variable, it is called variable declaration. For instance in the example below my first name is assigned to 
a variable first_name. The equal sign is an assignment operator. Assigning means storing data in the variable. The equal sign in Python is not equality as in Math.

Example:
first_name = 'natan'
last_name = 'Ir'
country = 'Israhel'
city = 'Rishon'
age = 69
is_married = True
skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React', 'Python']
person_info = {
   'firstname':'natan',
   'lastname':'Ir',
   'country':'Israhell',
   'city':'Rishon'
   }

Let us use the print() and len() built-in functions. Print function takes unlimited number of arguments.
An argument is a value which we can be passed or put inside the function parenthesis, see the example below.

print('Hello, World!') # The text Hello, World! is an argument
print('Hello',',', 'World','!') # it can take multiple arguments, four arguments have been passed
print(len('Hello, World!')) # it takes only one argument

Let us print and also find the length of the variables declared at the top:
print('First name:', first_name)
print('First name length:', len(first_name))
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Last name length: ', len(last_name))
print('Country: ', country)
print('City: ', city)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)
print('Skills: ', skills)
print('Person information: ', person_info)

Declaring Multiple Variable in a Line:
first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married = 'Natan', 'Ir', 'Rishon', 69, False

when printing each var:
print(first_name, last_name, country, age, is_married)
print('First name:', first_name)
print('Last name: ', last_name)
print('Country: ', country)
print('Age: ', age)
print('Married: ', is_married)

Getting user input using the input() built-in function. Let us assign the data we get from a user into first_name and age variables. Example:
first_name = input('What is your name: ')
age = input('How old are you? ')

print(first_name)
print(age)

Data Types:
There are several data types in Python. To identify the data type we use the type built-in function.
I would like to ask you to focus on understanding different data types very well. When it comes to programming, it is all about data types.
I introduced data types at the very beginning and it comes again, because every topic is related to data types. We will cover data types in more detail
in their respective sections.
Check Data types: To check the data type of certain data/variable we use the type Example:
first_name = 'Natab'     # str
last_name = 'Ir'       # str
country = 'Israhel'         # str
city= 'Rishon'            # str
age = 69                   # int, it is not my real age, don't worry about it

# Printing out types
print(type('Natan'))     # str
print(type(first_name))     # str
print(type(10))             # int
print(type(3.14))           # float
print(type(1 + 1j))         # complex
print(type(True))           # bool
print(type([1, 2, 3, 4]))     # list
print(type({'name':'Natan','age':69, 'is_married':False}))    # dict
print(type((1,2)))                                              # tuple
print(type(zip([1,2],[3,4])))                                   # set

Casting: Converting one data type to another data type. We use int(), float(), str(), list, set When we do arithmetic operations string numbers
should be first converted to int or float otherwise it will return an error. If we concatenate a number with a string, the number should be first converted to a string.
We will talk about concatenation in String section.
# int to float
num_int = 10
print('num_int',num_int)         # 10
num_float = float(num_int)
print('num_float:', num_float)   # 10.0

# float to int
gravity = 9.81
print(int(gravity))             # 9

# int to str
num_int = 10
print(num_int)                  # 10
num_str = str(num_int)
print(num_str)                  # '10'

# str to int or float
num_str = '10.6'
print('num_int', int(num_str))      # 10
print('num_float', float(num_str))  # 10.6

# str to list
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
print(first_name)               # 'Asabeneh'
first_name_to_list = list(first_name)
print(first_name_to_list)            # ['A', 's', 'a', 'b', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'h']
