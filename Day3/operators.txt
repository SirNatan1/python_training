Operators: Python language supports several types of operators. In this section, we will focus on few of them.
Assignment Operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Let us take = as an example. Equal sign in mathematics shows that two values are equal, 
however in Python it means we are storing a value in a certain variable and we call it assignment or a assigning value to a variable.
Example for assignment Ops:
=     x = 5       x = 5
+=    x += 5      x = x + 5         x = 5       x = 5 + 5
-=    x -= 3      x = x - 3
*=    x *= 4      x = x * 4
&=    x &= 3      x = x & 3
To sum it up Assign Ops are used to assign a value to a var and than using the var to add/sub/multiplie... and save the result in the used var

Arithmetic Ops: regular math Ops for regular math Ops
Example Integer:
+     x + y
-     x - y
*     x * y
/     x / y
%     x % y

Integer examples:
print('Division: ', 7 / 2) -> output: Division: 3.5
print('Modulus: ', 3 % 2) -> output: Modulus: 1
print('Exponentiation: ', 2 ** 3) -> output: Exponentiation: 9
So, it'll print out the string in '' and add to the print togther with the print the sum of the operators.

Example float:
